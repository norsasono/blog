First. Let me tell you that it is just another update and I wouldn't explain the new features as they have been explained [here](https://dev.ghost.org/) in every developer blog post. Just go and read it.

Second. I also try to explain it briefly as I assume that you have read the others posts I wrote before [here](https://blog.sasono.web.id/2016/08/02/update-ghost-0-9-0-using-openshift-quickstart/) and [here](https://blog.sasono.web.id/2016/06/04/update-ghost-0-8-0-using-openshift-quickstart/).

## Backup
Remember to always do a backup first before doing an upgrade.

1. Go to your `blog dashboard` > `Labs` > then hit the `Export` button. This will export your settings and your content to a json file that you can import whenever you need it.
2. Make a snapshot of your cartridge by using this command in your terminal `rhc snapshot save <app_name>`. You can read about this in [here](https://developers.openshift.com/managing-your-applications/backing-up-applications.html).

## Pre Update
Please make sure you have installed the right version of **node.js** in your machine, just take a look at [this post](http://support.ghost.org/supported-node-versions/) for the compabilities. I use **4.2** as this is the recommended one and the version of Node that they use with Ghost in production on Ghost(Pro). 

Type `node -v` to show the version.

Then tidy up your application to prevent a *Not Enough Space* error. Just run this command on your terminal.

`rhc app tidy <your-application-name>`

## Update
In order to the new **Node.js** support and **a few dependency updates**, you should modify your `package.json` file in your root app folder. I have changed the node version and added the newest dependencies update. You may choose whatever you want. Here is **mine**:
